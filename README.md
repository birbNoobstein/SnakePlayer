# SnakePlayer
### AI that plays Snake using A* and reverse A* algorithm (probably not sure yet ?)

#### Quickstart:
`python snackysnake.py`

#### Dependencies:
- numpy
- pygame

##### Files:
- `sanckysnake` --> The snake game
- `astar_algorithm` --> Path-finding algorithm


Notes:
- Everytime snake reaches the apple it gets longer for 1 square
- At the moment it uses only Manhattan distance
