### AI that plays Snake using A* and reverse A* algorithm (probably not sure yet ?)

##### Quickstart:
`python snackysnek.py`

#### Dependencies:
- numpy
- pygame

##### Files:
- `snackysnek.py` --> The snake game
- `pathfinding_algorithm.py` --> Path-finding algorithm


##### Notes:
- Everytime snake reaches the apple it gets longer for 1 square
- At the moment it uses only Manhattan distance with some conditions

#### A* algorithm
